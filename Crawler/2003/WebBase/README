Depending on the source you obtained, you should have at least one of the
following files, and follow its instructions accordingly:
README.client    	retrieve streams of Web pages from WebBase
README.crawler   	run a Web crawler over the World Wide Web

README.server    	build and run a WebBase Web-page server at Stanford
README.text-index	build a text index for Web pages at Stanford's WebBase

WebBase is built on GNU/Linux (e.g. Red Hat Linux 7.x) and Solaris (e.g.
SunOS 5.8) using GNU make (gmake) and gcc 2.9x.
(Not all code is ISO-C++ compliant; therefore, this code may fail to build 
on gcc 3.x.)
